2. **Use GitHub Desktop**: After initial setup, download GitHub Desktop for easier file management.

3. **Keep Backups**: Save copies of your content before uploading.

4. **Test Locally**: Open index.html in your browser before uploading to check for errors.

5. **Organize Images**: Create subfolders in `images/` for different topics.
